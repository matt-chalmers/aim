# Upgrading

How a repository that uses this harness learns the plugin moved, and what it does about it.

## The mechanism

`claude plugin update` replaces the plugin cache wholesale. It ships no hook, and it changes
nothing in your repository — so on its own, a `harness.yaml` written for 0.9.0 runs under
0.9.1 forever, silently missing every block the newer version reads.

The stamp is what closes that gap. `harness.yaml` carries the plugin version it was last
reviewed against:

```yaml
harness:
  version: 0.9.1
```

[`check-project-config.sh`](reference/checks.md) compares it with the installed plugin and
reports one of:

| it says | meaning | what happens |
|---|---|---|
| `harness: 0.9.1  installed plugin 0.9.1` | current | nothing |
| `UPGRADE: … written for 0.9.0; 0.9.1 is installed` | the plugin moved on | advisory by hand; `--strict` exits 3, and the `/campaign` and `/swarm` pre-flights run it that way, so a run **stops** until the config is reviewed |
| `UPGRADE: … carries no harness.version` | written before stamping existed | as above — treated as older than every note below |
| `WARN: … stamped 0.9.2 but the installed plugin is 0.9.1` | the **plugin** is behind | `claude plugin update mad-harness@aim` |

`/harness-setup` is the upgrade path. On a repository that already has a `harness.yaml` it
reads the notes below, applies every section newer than the stamp — oldest first — and
re-stamps. It never rewrites a block the owner already settled.

**Discipline on the plugin side**, enforced by the test suite: every version has a section
here (even if it says "nothing to do"), and the template and the harness's own config are
stamped with the current version. A bump cannot ship without saying what it asks of you.

## Notes per version

Oldest first, so `/harness-setup` applies them in order. Each item is **mechanical** —
applied without asking, then reported — or **ask the owner** — it needs a fact only the
owner has, asked once with whatever the repository already answers.

### 0.9.0

The first release. A config written for it is the baseline; nothing to apply.

### 0.9.1

- **ask the owner** — declare `ports:`, every TCP port the project's servers bind, by
  name. The pre-flight probes them for a server left running by a killed run. Read the
  candidates off the stack modules and the framework's dev-server convention (Next.js
  3000, Django 8000) and confirm; `ports: {}` if nothing listens. Absent, the config check
  warns on every run.
- **mechanical** — rename a `tasks:` block to `beads:`. The template shipped the wrong name;
  the code and this skill always read `beads.prefix`. Only present in configs copied from
  the 0.9.0 template.
- **mechanical** — nothing to change for it, but say so: every script now finds the
  project from the directory it is called in, so `MAD_HARNESS_REPO=…` prefixes added as a
  workaround are no longer needed. A tracker that cannot find its database now fails
  loudly rather than reporting an empty backlog.
- **mechanical** — stamp `harness.version`.
